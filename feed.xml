                <h3 id="mcetoc_1dsqkbs450">Derivative of univariate function</h3>
<p>To understand what is Jacobian, we need to revisit the derivative of a univariate function wherein $f$ maps the real line into the real line, that is, $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R} $. The derivative of $f$ denoted by $f'$ measures the sensitivity to change of the function value (output value, $f(x)$) with respect to a change in its argument (input value, $x$). Now the question is how we can measure the change of a function whose inputs is a vector in $\mathbb{R}^n$. From this point on we will focus on the change in a value of a function and try to associate it to the derivative of a univariate function.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: $f'$ is also denoted by $\frac{df}{dx}$ which is read as the derivative of $f$ with respect to $x$. Here we have used $d$ since there is no other variables that derivative is being taken with respect to them.</p>
<p><strong>Remark: </strong>If $x$ becomes a number in real line instead of a vector, the gradient becomes the derivative which was expected.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1dsqkdumb1">The gradient of a real-valued function</h3>
<p>When $f$ takes on a vector $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ where $x = [x_1, x_2, \cdots,x_n]^{\top}$ and maps it to a number on the real line, we write $f : \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. Since we have the ability to play with each coordinate of $x$ to change the value of the function, the concept of gradient comes into the picture. The gradient is a vector with the same length of $x$ and each coordinate shows the change in the value of $f$ when the corresponding coordinate changes. Therefore, we write</p>
<p> \begin{equation}<br>\nabla f = [\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_2}, \cdots, \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_n}]^{\top}<br>\end{equation}</p>
<p>Here we use $\nabla$ (nabla) symbol to suppress the right hand side when we want to address all the changes along $n$ directions. Also, $\partial$ is used to clarify that other than (let's say $x_1$), there are other variables whose change can affect the value of $f$.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1dsqmf85h2">Jacobian of a vector-valued function</h3>
<p>Now let's get back to the question that I asked in the page title. You might say, "well, Jacobian matrix should be something that somehow connects to the change of a vector-valued function which takes a vector as its input". Yes correct! But how we do we write it?</p>
<p>First notice that we have $f$ where $f: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$, that is:</p>
<p>$$<br> f(x)=f(x_1, x_2, \cdots,x_n)= \begin{bmatrix}<br> f_1(x_1, x_2, \cdots,x_n)\\ f_2(x_1, x_2, \cdots,x_n)\\ \vdots \\ f_n(x_1, x_2, \cdots,x_n)<br> \end{bmatrix}<br>$$</p>
<p>As you can see the value of each function $f_i$ where $i= 1, 2, \cdots, m$ can vary when one of $x_j$'s changes. This is where Jacobian matrix comes into the picture. It is defined as the following:</p>
<p>$$<br>J_f(x)= \begin{bmatrix}<br>\frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_1} &amp; \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_2}&amp; \cdots&amp; \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_n}\\<br>\frac{\partial f_2}{\partial x_1} &amp; \frac{\partial f_2}{\partial x_2}&amp; \cdots&amp; \frac{\partial f_2}{\partial x_n}\\<br> \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \cdots &amp; \vdots\\<br>\frac{\partial f_m}{\partial x_1} &amp; \frac{\partial f_m}{\partial x_2}&amp; \cdots&amp; \frac{\partial f_m}{\partial x_n}<br>\end{bmatrix}<br>=<br>\begin{bmatrix}<br>\nabla^{\top} f_1\\<br>\nabla^{\top} f_2\\<br>\vdots\\<br>\nabla^{\top} f_n\\<br>\end{bmatrix}<br>$$</p>
<p>By looking at $i$-th row of the Jacobian matrix, we see that it is transpose of the gradient of $f_i$, i.e., $(\nabla f_i)^{\top}$ which I denoted by $\nabla^{\top} f_i$ . </p>
<p><strong>Remark 1</strong>: If $f$ becomes a scalar-valued function and $x$ becomes a number in real line instead of a vector, the Jacobian matrix becomes the derivative!</p>
<p><strong>Remark 2</strong>: Jacobian matrix is the matrix of all first-order partial derivatives of the function.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1dsr1mght0">Why do we need Jacobian matrix?</h3>
<p>Jacobian of a composition function is the product of the Jacobian matrices of each functions. Suppose we have the following fucntion:</p>
<p>$$<br>f (x)= f_1(f_2(\cdots( f_n(x) ) ) = f_1 \circ f_2 \circ \cdots\circ f_n(x)<br>$$</p>
<p>The Jacobian matrix of $f$ with respect to $x$ is:</p>
<p>$$<br>J_f = J_{f_1} \cdot J_{f_2} \cdots J_{f_n}(x)<br>$$</p>
<p>However, there is a big caveat here; in order to find Jacobian matrix of $f$, we need to find all other Jacobian matrices. We know Jacobian matrix is all first-order partial derivatives of the vector-valued function with respect to its variable. But what is the variable of, let's say $f_1$? The variable of $f_1$ is the f but $f_1$, i.e., $f_2(f_3(\cdots( f_n(x) ) ) = f_2 \circ f_3 \circ \cdots\circ f_n(x)$. </p>
<p>I will go through an example and clarify all those abstract concepts that were discussed in the last paragraph in <a href="https://sdamadi.github.io/jacobian-of-a-composition-function.html">this post</a>. </p>
