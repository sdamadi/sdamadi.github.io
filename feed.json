            "content_html": "<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1dsqkbs450\">Derivative of univariate function</h3>\n<p>To understand what is Jacobian, we need to revisit the derivative of a univariate function wherein $f$ maps the real line into the real line, that is, $f: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R} $. The derivative of $f$ denoted by $f'$ measures the sensitivity to change of the function value (output value, $f(x)$) with respect to a change in its argument (input value, $x$). Now the question is how we can measure the change of a function whose inputs is a vector in $\\mathbb{R}^n$. From this point on we will focus on the change in a value of a function and try to associate it to the derivative of a univariate function.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: $f'$ is also denoted by $\\frac{df}{dx}$ which is read as the derivative of $f$ with respect to $x$. Here we have used $d$ since there is no other variables that derivative is being taken with respect to them.</p>\n<p><strong>Remark: </strong>If $x$ becomes a number in real line instead of a vector, the gradient becomes the derivative which was expected.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1dsqkdumb1\">The gradient of a real-valued function</h3>\n<p>When $f$ takes on a vector $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ where $x = [x_1, x_2, \\cdots,x_n]^{\\top}$ and maps it to a number on the real line, we write $f : \\mathbb{R}^n \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$. Since we have the ability to play with each coordinate of $x$ to change the value of the function, the concept of gradient comes into the picture. The gradient is a vector with the same length of $x$ and each coordinate shows the change in the value of $f$ when the corresponding coordinate changes. Therefore, we write</p>\n<p> \\begin{equation}<br>\\nabla f = [\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_1}, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_2}, \\cdots, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_n}]^{\\top}<br>\\end{equation}</p>\n<p>Here we use $\\nabla$ (nabla) symbol to suppress the right hand side when we want to address all the changes along $n$ directions. Also, $\\partial$ is used to clarify that other than (let's say $x_1$), there are other variables whose change can affect the value of $f$.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1dsqmf85h2\">Jacobian of a vector-valued function</h3>\n<p>Now let's get back to the question that I asked in the page title. You might say, \"well, Jacobian matrix should be something that somehow connects to the change of a vector-valued function which takes a vector as its input\". Yes correct! But how we do we write it?</p>\n<p>First notice that we have $f$ where $f: \\mathbb{R}^n \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^m$, that is:</p>\n<p>$$<br> f(x)=f(x_1, x_2, \\cdots,x_n)= \\begin{bmatrix}<br> f_1(x_1, x_2, \\cdots,x_n)\\\\ f_2(x_1, x_2, \\cdots,x_n)\\\\ \\vdots \\\\ f_n(x_1, x_2, \\cdots,x_n)<br> \\end{bmatrix}<br>$$</p>\n<p>As you can see the value of each function $f_i$ where $i= 1, 2, \\cdots, m$ can vary when one of $x_j$'s changes. This is where Jacobian matrix comes into the picture. It is defined as the following:</p>\n<p>$$<br>J_f(x)= \\begin{bmatrix}<br>\\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x_1} &amp; \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x_2}&amp; \\cdots&amp; \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x_n}\\\\<br>\\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial x_1} &amp; \\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial x_2}&amp; \\cdots&amp; \\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial x_n}\\\\<br> \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\vdots\\\\<br>\\frac{\\partial f_m}{\\partial x_1} &amp; \\frac{\\partial f_m}{\\partial x_2}&amp; \\cdots&amp; \\frac{\\partial f_m}{\\partial x_n}<br>\\end{bmatrix}<br>=<br>\\begin{bmatrix}<br>\\nabla^{\\top} f_1\\\\<br>\\nabla^{\\top} f_2\\\\<br>\\vdots\\\\<br>\\nabla^{\\top} f_n\\\\<br>\\end{bmatrix}<br>$$</p>\n<p>By looking at $i$-th row of the Jacobian matrix, we see that it is transpose of the gradient of $f_i$, i.e., $(\\nabla f_i)^{\\top}$ which I denoted by $\\nabla^{\\top} f_i$ . </p>\n<p><strong>Remark 1</strong>: If $f$ becomes a scalar-valued function and $x$ becomes a number in real line instead of a vector, the Jacobian matrix becomes the derivative!</p>\n<p><strong>Remark 2</strong>: Jacobian matrix is the matrix of all first-order partial derivatives of the function.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1dsqpjd0t0\">Why do we need Jacobian matrix?</h3>\n<p>Jacobian of a composition function is the product of the Jacobian matrices of each functions. Suppose we have the following fucntion:</p>\n<p>$$<br>f (x)= f_1(f_2(\\cdots( f_n(x) ) ) = f_1 \\circ f_2 \\circ \\cdots\\circ f_n(x)<br>$$</p>\n<p>The Jacobian matrix of $f$ with respect to $x$ is:</p>\n<p>$$<br>J_f = J_{f_1} \\cdot J_{f_2} \\cdots J_{f_n}(x)<br>$$</p>\n<p>However, there is a big caveat here; in order to find Jacobian matrix of $f$, we need to find all other Jacobian matrices. We know Jacobian matrix is all first-order partial derivatives of the vector-valued function with respect to its variable. But what is the variable of, let's say $f_1$? The variable of $f_1$ is the f but $f_1$, i.e., $f_2(f_3(\\cdots( f_n(x) ) ) = f_2 \\circ f_3 \\circ \\cdots\\circ f_n(x)$. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://sdamadi.github.io/jacobian-of-a-composition-function.html\">In this post</a> I will go through an example and clarify all those abstract concepts that were discussed in the last paragraph.</p>",

If $f$ and $g$ are given separately as two functions like $f(z)$ and $g(x)$, to find $J_f(g(x))$ it suffice to find the jacobian of $f$ with respect to $z$ then substitute coordinates of $g(x)$ in as the coordinates of $z$. Precisely, we have $J_f(z) \\circ g(x)$.</li>\n<li id=\"6b\">When $h(x)$ is given as a function of $x$, then we are back to the case where Jacobian matrix can be found as the way we found it for a vector-valued fucntion in <a href=\"https://sdamadi.github.io/what-is-jacobian-and-why-do-we-need-it.html\">the other post</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In what follows, I will walk you through what I discussed for the above case. Suppose we are given</p>\n<p>$f\\left(u,v\\right)=u^{2}+3v^{2}$,</p>\n<p>$g\\left(x,y\\right)=\\begin{bmatrix} e^{x}\\cos y  \\\\ e^{x}\\sin y \\end{bmatrix} $,</p>\n<p>and the goal is finding the Jacobian matrix of the composite function.  Also, let the composite function be $h$.</p>\n<p><strong>Question: </strong>$h$ is the composite function of $f$ and $g$ or $g$ and $f$?</p>\n<p><strong>Answer: </strong>To clarify the above question, we are required to think of $f$ and $g$ as two mappings where $f: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ and $g: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^2$.</p>\n<p>Suppose $h = f \\circ g$.</p>\n<p>Since $g$ is the last function in the composite function, variables of $h$ are going to be vaibales of $g$. Therefore, $J_h(x, y) = J_f(g(u,v))J_g(x, y)$. <a href=\"#1b\">According to the first and second bullet</a>, $J_f(g(u,v))$ is a $1 \\times 2$ matrix and $J_g(x, y)$ is a $2 \\times 2$ matrix. Hence, the result is a $1 \\times 2$ matrix. However, if we flip $f$ and $g$, and consider $h$ as $h=g \\circ f$ and we should have</p>\n<p>$$J_h(u, v) \\stackrel{?}{=} J_g(f(u,v))J_f(u, y)$$</p>\n<p>It is easy to see <a href=\"#1b\">from the first bullet</a> that we have a $1 \\times 2$ for $J_f(u, v)$ matrix but $J_g(f(x,y))$ is not defind since one should take the derivatives of all coordinates of $g$ with respect to all varibales of $g$ which are now coordinates of $f$; but $f$ is a scalar-valued function and does not output the same dimension as $g$ input needs. In effect, $h=g \\circ f$ is not defined. Hence, by compostion function, we mean $h = f \\circ g$.</p>\n<p>Let's first compute $J_g(x, y)$ where $g$ is a function of $x,y$ and it is a vector-valued function so</p>\n<p>$$<br> J_g(x, y) = \\begin{bmatrix}<br>\\frac{\\partial g_1}{\\partial x} &amp; \\frac{\\partial g_1}{\\partial y} \\\\<br>\\frac{\\partial g_2}{\\partial x} &amp; \\frac{\\partial g_2}{\\partial y} <br> \\end{bmatrix}=<br>\\begin{bmatrix}<br>e^x\\cos y &amp; -e^x\\sin y \\\\ e^x\\sin y &amp; e^x\\cos y<br>\\end{bmatrix}$$  </p>\n<p>Now to compute $J_f(g(u,v))$ <a href=\"#5b\">using the fifth bullet</a> which yields<br>$$<br>\\begin{align}<br>J_f(g(u,v)) &amp;= J_f(z = (u,v))\\circ g(x,y)\\\\<br> &amp;= <br>\\begin{bmatrix}<br>\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial u} &amp; \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial v}<br> \\end{bmatrix} \\circ g(x,y) \\\\<br>&amp;=\\begin{bmatrix}<br>2u &amp; 6v<br>\\end{bmatrix}\\circ g(x,y)\\\\<br>&amp;=\\begin{bmatrix}<br>2u &amp; 6v<br>\\end{bmatrix}\\circ<br>\\begin{bmatrix}<br>e^{x}\\cos y \\\\ e^{x}\\sin y<br>\\end{bmatrix}\\\\<br>&amp;=<br>\\begin{bmatrix} 2e^{x}\\cos y &amp; 6e^{x}\\sin y \\end{bmatrix}<br>\\end{align}<br>$$<br><br>Finally,</p>\n<p>$$<br>\\begin{align}<br>J_{h}(x,y) &amp;= J_{f \\circ g}(x,y) = J_f(g(u,v)) J_g(x, y)\\\\<br>&amp;=<br>\\begin{bmatrix} 2e^{x}\\cos y &amp; 6e^{x}\\sin y \\end{bmatrix}<br>\\begin{bmatrix}<br>e^x\\cos y &amp; -e^x\\sin y \\\\ e^x\\sin y &amp; e^x\\cos y<br>\\end{bmatrix}\\\\<br>&amp;= <br>\\begin{bmatrix}<br>2e^{2x}\\cos^2y + 6e^{2x}\\sin^2y &amp; -2e^{2x}\\cos y \\sin y + 6e^{2x}\\sin y\\cos y<br>\\end{bmatrix} \\\\<br>&amp;= <br>2e^{2x}<br>\\begin{bmatrix}<br>1 + 2\\sin^2y &amp; 2\\sin y\\cos y <br>\\end{bmatrix}<br>\\end{align}\\\\<br>$$</p>\n<p> <strong>Conclusion: </strong>We went through all the steps of finding the Jacobian matrix of a composite function consists of two functions.
