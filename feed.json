Likewise the picture, the reflection on the water is 2D representation of 3D city which need less space!</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.5pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: #2a2e30;\">To understand Principle Component Analysis (PCA) in stochastic setting assume $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ be a random vector. Also, assume $x$ is distributed according to a distribution $D$ which is unknown.</span></p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.6rem 0px 0px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; widows: 2; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; word-spacing: 0px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.5pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: #2a2e30;\">Knowing the fact that $x$ lives in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, immediately brings a question whether $x$ is bounded or not. When $x$ is not bounded we can say nothing about how big it is but when $x$ is bounded we know it can be contained in a ball with radius $R$ where $\\mathbb{E}[\\|x\\|_2^2] \\leq R$.</span></p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.6rem 0px 0px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; widows: 2; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; word-spacing: 0px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.5pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: #2a2e30;\"><strong>Note</strong>: Talking about boundedness requires a measure which is $\\ell_2$-norm in this case (but it could be any norm). In addition, the reason behind the expected value is that we are dealing with a random vector that takes on any value in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, but cannot talk about the exact maximum of $x$. Hence, we are interested in the maximum it can achieve on the average, that is why we have expectation.</span></p>",
